# Issho
A collection of standalone music tools.

# Hachi
A multi-function midi sequencer that runs on a Novation Launchpad Pro and a headless computer 
like a Raspberry Pi. Hachi is written in Java, and so can run on a Pi (tested), 
a Mac (tested), and many other platforms (untested), with or without keyboard and monitor.

Hachi (= "eight" in Japanese) can run up to 8 "modules" at a time. Available modules 
include several midi sequencers, a paint/animation toy, and a sequencer-controller that 
lets you coordinate your sequencers. Hachi is a generalized version 
of [this simpler sequencer](https://github.com/perkowitz/sequence) 
that I wrote for the original Launchpad. 
That basic sequencer runs as one module in Hachi.
