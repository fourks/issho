# Overview

"Shihai" means "control" in Japanese. The Shihai module is intended to control both Hachi itself and other modules. It can
be used to set Hachi's clock tempo, select sessions and patterns (for modules that use sessions or patterns), set chords
(for modules that use chords), and display a simple measure/beat clock.
